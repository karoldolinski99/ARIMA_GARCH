# ARIMA_GARCH

The project was made in R language.

The aim of this project is time series modeling using ARMA and ARIMA models. In the work, first, the stationarity of the series was examined and the appropriate model was fitted along with the verification of the necessary assumptions. Then, the presence of the ARCH effect was checked and price forecasts were determined.
